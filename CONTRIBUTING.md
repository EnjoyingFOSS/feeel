Feeel is a hobby project that I'm working on in my spare time. As such, any further development relies on the work of enthusiastic volunteers wanting to make the project a bit better.

Here's how you can get involved:

Develop
=======
You'll need to set up Flutter on your device ([Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#install-flutter-manually), [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos), or [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)) to work on Feeel. If you're developing for Linux, you'll also need to [install the prerequisites for the audio library Feeel uses](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/packages/audioplayers_linux/requirements.md).

Once that's done, find a development issue on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel/-/issues) and start working on it.

Submit exercise photos
======
Exercise photos are sorely needed. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel/-/issues/10) for a list.

The photos you submit must be your own work (copyright belongs only to you).

Process exercise photos
======
You can take already contributed or CC0, CC BY, or CC BY-SA photos and turn them into low-poly versions using the [FOSStriangulator app](https://github.com/FOSStriangulator/FOSStriangulator).

See [this tutorial](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel/-/wikis/Processing-photos) for a guide on how to triangulate.

Translate
=========
You can help translate through [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/feeel/strings/).

Spread the word
===============
Have a social media account? Or a blog? Give Feeel a mention!
