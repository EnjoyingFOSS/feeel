All unofficial builds and forks of the app must be clearly labeled as unofficial in the app's name (e.g. "Feeel UNOFFICIAL", never just "Feeel") or use a different name altogether. If any code changes are made, the fork should use a completely different name and app icon. All unofficial builds and forks MUST use a different application ID, in order to not conflict with a potential official release.
