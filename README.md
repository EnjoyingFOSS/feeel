Feeel
=====

Feeel is an open-source app for doing simple at-home exercises.

This is an in-progress rewrite of the [original app](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel-legacy) in Flutter. It doesn't work as it should yet, but hopefully it will soon. *Get involved* to speed up the process!

ANYONE can contribute, no special skills required. Message me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!jFShhgWHRXehKXrToU:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) if you'd like to help.

You can help by donating photos of exercises, [turning photos into low-poly illustrations](https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel/-/wikis/Processing-photos) (which anyone can do using an application made for the purpose), participating in user testing, [translating](https://www.transifex.com/enjoying-foss/feeel/), spreading the message, programming, or doing anything else that would help the project. :)
