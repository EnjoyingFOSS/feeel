To generate and publish a release:

1. Build the Linux release using Flutter.
2. Add the new release version and date to the start of the "releases" list in the "spec.json" file (and adjust other parameters in the file if needed).
3. Run "dart flatpak_generator.dart spec.json" in this folder.
4. Upload the generated tar.gz file as a Github release, using the app's version name for the tag (e.g. "1.0.0").
5. Test the Flatpak using the guide at https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html, using the generated json manifest as your Flatpak manifest.
6. (If uploading to Flathub for the first time, follow the official contributing guidelines https://github.com/flathub/flathub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md .)
7. Upload your Flathub manifest file to your Flathub Github repo, overwriting any old manifest file you may have there. (If you're building for x86_64 only and the "flathub.json" file is not in your Flathub Github repo yet, upload that too.)
