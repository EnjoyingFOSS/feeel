Only slightly so, so that elbows are still in front of the body rather than squarely to the side.\nYour body should be straight and pointed slightly forward. Your arms should be extended.\n\nSteps:\n1. Use your strength to pull your body up evenly, bringing your chest closer to the pull-up bar and your chin just above it. Do NOT lift yourself up using momentum, such as kicking.\n2. Carefully lower your body back down to starting position.\n3. Repeat.\n\nTips:\n- To do pull-ups correctly, you must first build up strength in several key areas, including shoulders, arms, and abs. Start with pull-ups only after you have built up enough strength with other exercises.",
